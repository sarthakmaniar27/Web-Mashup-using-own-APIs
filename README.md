# Web-Mashup-using-own-APIs

## I have developed a website using the concept of Web Mashup by combining two own REST APIs in Flask

#### The two APIs used are:
###### 1.) Student API 
###### 2.) Committee API

For developing the student API, I found the records of my class such as Student's UID, First Name, Last Name, Email Id and the Committee to which he/she belongs and listed out in an excel sheet. Later converted that data from excel to csv and finally from CSV to Json format.
For the Committee API, i have created a json file with two attributes namely, "name" and "about". 

The methods for calling these APIs are present in the respective python files. In the client.py file, I'm combining my two APIs. 
For the frontend, i have simply used Html and CSS.

## Here are the screenshots of my website:
